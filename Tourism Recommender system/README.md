# 🧳 Travel & Tourism Recommendation System

This project focuses on building a **Travel & Tourism Recommendation System** using **Python** and **machine learning** techniques. It provides personalized destination suggestions based on user preferences, travel history, reviews, and more. Both **content-based** and **collaborative filtering** methods are implemented, along with a **popularity prediction model** using a Random Forest Regressor.
